# FishingGame
This is a project I created to help me learn the Godot Engine and its workflow

The game I created is a simple fishing game where you can move a player around a lake and fish in designated areas.

Controls
    To move the player character use the WASD or arrow keys.
    To fish, move to a spot where fish can be seen and press E.
    To sell your fish move to the dock and your fish will be sold automatically.

# Development Environment

* Godot Game engine can be found on steam or downloaded [here](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)

# Languages

* GDScript


# Useful Websites

* [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html)
* [GodotGPT (Try it out if you have access, I did not)](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHBaWkxXcUU0SjlqSkVnNENKem1tSmsxU0tSQXxBQ3Jtc0ttQlZuVlV2MnpQeGxDUHR5Vk9zTFpuUG9tX2I0X2VVcDZPMUlUOTlNanVwcjdDZUMzb2p1ZEZ1eWZ4a2x5NUJMdk5qS2JLQVJVdjNZT19fN0xielk1NWRMdERFYjRIWngxcmJyNzJRMkhSR2VTSEFvZw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.openai.com%2Fg%2Fg-lOitl3G5X-godotgpt&v=jiGVzhjNlbw)
I DO NOT recommend using the regular ChatGPT for godot since it may be out of date.

# Future Work

* Add animations to the player and environment
* Create a shopping interface to spend coins on upgrades
* Create upgrades that allow you to visit new areas, catch new fish, fish faster, etc.
